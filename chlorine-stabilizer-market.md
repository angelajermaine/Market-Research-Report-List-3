<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorine Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyanuric Acid Tablets</li><li>Cyanuric Acid Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlorine stabilizer, also known as cyanuric acid, can be found in two forms in the market: tablets and granular. Cyanuric acid tablets are slow-dissolving and are typically placed in a floating dispenser or skimmer basket, releasing the stabilizer gradually. On the other hand, cyanuric acid granular is quick-dissolving and can be broadcast directly into the pool water. Both forms of cyanuric acid help to protect chlorine from UV degradation, ensuring that it remains effective in sanitizing the pool water.</p></p>
