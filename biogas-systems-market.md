<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas systems are classified into two main types: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion systems involve the decomposition of organic materials in a liquid environment, producing biogas. On the other hand, dry digestion systems use solid materials, such as crop residues or manure, to generate biogas. Both types of systems are used to efficiently convert organic waste into energy, with wet digestion being more suitable for liquid waste and dry digestion for solid waste. Each system has its advantages and applications depending on the waste materials available for digestion.</p></p>
