<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing leads are used in emergency situations to control heart rate and rhythm. There are two main types of pacing leads: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar leads have one pacing electrode that delivers electrical impulses to the heart, while bipolar leads have two pacing electrodes that work together to stimulate the heart. Both types of leads are effective in providing temporary pacing support, with bipolar leads offering more precise control and less risk of tissue damage compared to unipolar leads.</p></p>
