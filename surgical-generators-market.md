<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Referenced Generators</li><li>Isolated Generators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical generators in the medical device market can be categorized into two main types: ground referenced generators and isolated generators. Ground referenced generators are designed to be connected to a ground potential in order to provide a safe electrical circuit for surgical instruments. On the other hand, isolated generators are able to operate independently of ground potential, providing additional safety measures. Both types of generators are essential in surgical procedures to deliver precise, controlled electrical energy for cutting, coagulating, and ablating tissues.</p></p>
