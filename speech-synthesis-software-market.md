<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speech Synthesis Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concatenation Synthesis</li><li>Formant Synthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Speech synthesis software can be classified into two main types: concatenation synthesis and formant synthesis. </p><p>Concatenation synthesis involves piecing together recorded speech fragments to create a natural-sounding output. This method is effective at producing realistic speech but may lack flexibility in generating new utterances.</p><p>On the other hand, formant synthesis uses mathematical models to generate speech sounds based on speech production principles. While this approach offers more control over the generated speech, it may sound less natural compared to concatenation synthesis.</p></p>
