<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>BI-V ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable Cardiac Devices market includes Pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), and Bi-Ventricular ICDs (BI-V ICDs). Pacemakers are used to regulate abnormal heart rhythms by sending electrical impulses to the heart. ICDs continuously monitor heart rhythms and deliver shocks to restore normal heartbeats in case of dangerous arrhythmias. BI-V ICDs are designed for patients with heart failure, providing pacing to both sides of the heart to improve its efficiency. The ICD market is expected to grow due to increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and technological advancements.</p></p>
