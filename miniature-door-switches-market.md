<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Miniature Door Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Switches</li><li>Non-Contact Switches</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Miniature door switches are commonly categorized into two types - mechanical switches and non-contact switches. Mechanical switches operate by physical contact between two conductive materials when the door is opened or closed. Non-contact switches, on the other hand, use proximity sensors or magnetic fields to detect the door's movement without physical contact. Both types are widely used in various applications where space is limited and reliable door sensing is required, such as in security systems, industrial machinery, and home appliances.</p></p>
