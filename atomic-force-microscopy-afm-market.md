<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact AFM</li><li>Non-contact AFM</li><li>Dynamic Contact AFM</li><li>Tapping AFM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) market can be classified into different types based on their operational modes. Contact AFM involves the tip physically touching the sample surface, providing high resolution images. Non-contact AFM operates without directly touching the sample, reducing the risk of damage. Dynamic Contact AFM combines the benefits of both contact and non-contact modes by oscillating the tip near the sample surface. Tapping AFM uses intermittent contact to gather topographic information while minimizing sample damage. Each type caters to specific needs in various research fields.</p></p>
