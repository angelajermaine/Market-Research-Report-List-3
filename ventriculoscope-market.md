<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventriculoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible</li><li>Rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventriculoscope is a medical device used to visualize and treat conditions within the ventricles of the brain. There are two main types of ventriculoscope: flexible and rigid. Flexible ventriculoscopes are able to navigate through tight spaces and angles within the ventricles, making them ideal for intricate procedures. Rigid ventriculoscopes, on the other hand, provide more stability and control during procedures but may be limited in their ability to reach certain areas. Both types play a crucial role in neurosurgery and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the procedure.</p></p>
