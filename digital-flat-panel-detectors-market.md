<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Flat Panel Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPD</li><li>Direct Conversion FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital flat panel detectors are utilized in medical imaging systems for capturing X-ray images. Indirect Conversion FPDs use a scintillator material to convert X-rays into light, which is then converted into electrical signals. Direct Conversion FPDs, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using semiconductor materials. Indirect Conversion FPDs are more commonly used due to their lower cost, but Direct Conversion FPDs offer better image quality and efficiency. Both types play a crucial role in modern medical imaging technology.</p></p>
