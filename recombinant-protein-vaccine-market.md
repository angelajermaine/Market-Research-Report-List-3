<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recombinant Protein Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bacterial Cells Culture</li><li>Mammalian Cells Culture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Recombinant protein vaccines are produced using two main types of cell cultures: bacterial cells culture and mammalian cells culture. Bacterial cells culture involves introducing the gene encoding the protein of interest into bacteria, allowing them to produce the desired protein. Mammalian cells culture, on the other hand, uses mammalian cells such as CHO cells to produce the recombinant protein vaccine. Each type of cell culture has its advantages and limitations in terms of protein expression levels, post-translational modifications, and scalability in the production of recombinant protein vaccines.</p></p>
