<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Borehole Packers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Inflatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Borehole packers are used for sealing boreholes in various industries such as mining, construction, and environmental applications. There are two main types of borehole packers: mechanical type and inflatable type. </p><p>Mechanical packers rely on a mechanical mechanism to expand and seal the borehole, providing a durable and long-lasting seal. In contrast, inflatable packers use air or water pressure to expand and seal the borehole, making them easier to install and remove compared to mechanical packers. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the project.</p></p>
