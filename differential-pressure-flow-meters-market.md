<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Pressure Flow Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Differential pressure flow meters can be classified into two main types - Type I and Type II. Type I meters operate on the principle of measuring the pressure drop across an obstruction in the flow path, such as an orifice plate or venturi tube. Type II meters, on the other hand, measure the pressure difference between two points in the flow stream. Type I meters are commonly used for measuring gas flow, while Type II meters are preferred for liquid flow applications due to their higher accuracy and reliability.</p></p>
